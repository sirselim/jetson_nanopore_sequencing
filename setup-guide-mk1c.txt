# DISCLAIMER: Oxford Nanopore Technologies is in no way endorsing or supporting 
# this method of installation of MinKNOW, or the devices that it is installed on.
# Also, please be fore warned that by following this set up guide neither the authors 
# or Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) are liable for any hardware/consumable damage
# or data loss that may arise.

# UPDATE 2023-11-15: these notes have been updated to support the latest updates
# in the ONT software stack, namely the introduction of dorado as the new production
# basecaller. This means that it is now possible to get a fully working install for
# sequencing with live basecalling on Jetson Orin based devices. This has been tested
# and confirmed working on an Nvidia Jetson Orin AGX.

# IMPORTANT: this guide installs ONT software from the M1kc repository, moving forward 
# this will become the supported "software stack" to install on arm-based Nvidia Jetson 
# devices. This replaces the original instructions which were based on the MinIT software.

# Notes: before running through these set up notes there are several steps that 
# require user action, namely: setting up the correct user/password, creating 
# a partition for the NVMe drive (if present), and editing the configuration
# files to include the correct directory structure. We will over time look
# to automate much of this, but just be warned for now that there are steps
# where you will need to get your hands dirty. ;)

# 0. pre-setup
# fresh install of Nvidia Jetson JetPack


# 1. get everything together before we start
cd ~/
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/sirselim/jetson_nanopore_sequencing.git
cd ./jetson_nanopore_sequencing


# 2. full system update and upgrade
# shouldn't take long with latest JetPack
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


# 3. add nanopore repo to system and update
# copy the apt sources file from this repo to system to ensure pointing at mk1c repository
sudo cp nanoporetech.sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
# add key
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ont-repo.asc https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/apt/ont-repo.pub
# update repos
sudo apt update


# 4. install ont packages
# this step is pulling from the latest ONT repo with Mk1c packages
# if you are building from cached debs replace this step with 'dpkg -i *.deb'
# the 'manual' way, these packages will pull in other required depends
sudo apt install minknow-core-minion-1c-offline ont-bream4-mk1c \
  ont-dorado-server-for-mk1c ont-dorado-models-for-mk1c \
  ont-configuration-customer-mk1c ont-kingfisher-ui-mk1c \
  ont-vbz-hdf-plugin ont-minion1c-fpga


# 5. edit the minknow conf files to change the location of data and enable GPU basecalling
# this can be done manually by using a text editor such as nano, this assumes you know what you want to edit:
#cd /opt/ont/minknow/conf
#sudo nano user_conf 
#sudo nano app_conf
# in app_conf you want to ensure that "gpu_calling" is set to true


# 6. prevent boot into MinKNOW UI
# there is a script that will start the Kingfisher UI upon log in, we can stop this to get a full desktop environment
sudo sed -i '1 s/^/#/' /etc/xprofile
# to revert this if you want to essentially have a mk1c and not access the desktop
# sudo sed -i '1 s/#//' /etc/xprofile
# remember to uncomment (remove the #) the above line to run it in your terminal


# 7. need to overwrite the values that identify the new device as a MinION Mk1c
# TODO - this is a horrible hack currently! At this stage we're hacking the Mk1c software to make it more "universal" for ARM devices.
# hopefully ONT will eventually release a mainline ARM64 version of the software that isn't tied to a specific device
# edit /etc/oxfordnanopore/configs/identity.config
# there is an error that this file can't be edited due to having an immutable flag, fix this:
sudo chattr -i /etc/oxfordnanopore/configs/identity.config
# now edit required values
sudo sed -i -e 's/Serial=.*/Serial=NONE/g' -e 's/ProductCode=.*/ProductCode=NONE/g' -e 's/Class=.*/Class=NONE/g' -e 's/Build=.*/Build=NONE/g' /etc/oxfordnanopore/configs/identity.config   
# Note: you can replace the Serial value of "NONE" with a value of your choice here if desired 
# (i.e. "My-XavNX", this is the value that will be used to name the device in ONT tools such as MinKNOW
# we need to do something similar in the app_conf file:
# edit /opt/ont/minknow/conf/app_conf
sudo sed -i -e 's/"device_type":.*/"device_type": "MinION",/' -e 's/"host_type":.*/"host_type": "PC",/' /opt/ont/minknow/conf/app_conf


# 8. Correct the MinKNOW UI zoom/scaling and remove the on screen keyboard
# The Mk1c software is designed to run on small 7inch touch screens, so there is a zoom factor that scales the UI and it looks
# bad on bigger screens. The software will also include a pop-up keyboard for touch screens by default. We turn these off.
sudo sed -i -e 's/--keyboard //g' -e 's/--zoom-factor 2/--zoom-factor 1/g' /usr/share/applications/minknow.desktop
# Note: if you are using a touch screen and would like the on screen keyboard then use the below:
# sudo sed -i -e 's/--zoom-factor 2/--zoom-factor 1/g' /usr/share/applications/minknow.desktop
# remember to uncomment (remove the #) the above line to run it in your terminal


# 9. set the correct firmware link
# because we aren't running the system id package things need a manual adjustment
# look for the firmware that is installed
ls -lhart /opt/ont/minknow/conf/firmware/
# should see something like `MinGrid_fx3_1_2_7_ONT.img`
# now check the usb_firmware.toml file
sudo nano /opt/ont/minknow/conf/usb_firmware.toml
# notice that the toml is linking to firmware that we don't have, change
# this to reflect the firmware that is installed
# should look something like the below:
# minion = "firmware/MinGrid_fx3_1_2_7_ONT.img"



# 10. copy minknow.service and guppyd.service across 
## minknow.service

# stop the service if it already exists
sudo systemctl stop minknow.service

# WARNING: with recent releases of MinKNOW there have been issues with libusb permissions, and the Mk1b device not being accessible
# a quick and dirty fix for this is to change the user and group from 'minit' to 'root'. If you have these issues you can run the below:
sudo systemctl edit minknow.service
# in the opened editor, add the following section (# not included)
# [Service]
# User=root
# Group=root

# if you ever want to set this back to minit that's easy as well:
sudo systemctl edit minknow.service
# in the opened editor, remove all content, save, and quit.
# IMPORTANT: remember to always restart the service after modifying any of these systemd files
#
## guppyd.service
# stop the service if it is already present
sudo systemctl stop guppyd.service
# copy guppyd.service to required location
sudo cp ./systemd_files/guppyd.service /lib/systemd/system/
# enable the service (if it hasn't been)
sudo systemctl enable guppyd.service
# start the service
sudo systemctl start guppyd.service
# check
systemctl status guppyd.service
# NOTE: the guppyd.service file contained in this repository is set with 8GB GPUs in mind, i.e. the Jetson Xavier NX
# these memory values can be edited to suit the GPU specs of a particular card/device, i.e. for the Xavier AGX a user
# might modify values to something like 24GB or even 32GB


# 11. you may require a system reboot at this stage. This is not always required, but for some people it sometimes fixes "niggles".
# TODO - confirm if this is required. I don't believe this to be required, but as a final hail mary it could be an option.


## optional steps

# install jetson-stats to allow nice hardware monitoring
# https://github.com/rbonghi/jetson_stats
sudo -H pip install -U jetson-stats
# needs a reboot/logout and then can use jtop
