# IMPORTANT: this guide installs ONT software from the M1kc repository, moving forward 
# this will become the supported "software stack" to install on arm-based Nvidia Jetson 
# devices. This replaces the original instructions which were based on the MinIT software.

# Notes: before running through these set up notes there are several steps that 
# require user action, namely: setting up the correct user/password, creating 
# a partition for the NVMe drive (if present), and editing the configuration
# files to include the correct directory structure. We will over time look
# to automate much of this, but just be warned for now that there are steps
# where you will need to get your hands dirty. ;)

# 0. pre-setup
# fresh inistall of Nvidia Jetson JetPack
# create user: minit with pw: minit
# TODO - determine whether this is still a requirement. For now it is working so will leave
# it as it is.


# 1. get everything together before we start
# ensure in /home/minit dir
cd ~/
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/sirselim/jetson_nanopore_sequencing.git
cd ./jetson_nanopore_sequencing
# download guppy from ONT servers
# NOTE: minknow requires specific versions of guppy for live base calling, using the wrong version will result 
# in crashes you can find an updated table of compatible versions here: 
# https://github.com/sirselim/jetson_nanopore_sequencing#minknow--guppy-compatibility
# this is the latest version of guppy for the current Minknow in release (21.05.25, minknow-core 5.0.16)
wget https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/software/analysis/ont-guppy_5.0.16_linuxaarch64_cuda10.tar.gz
# extract required packages
tar -xzvf *_linuxaarch64_cuda10.tar.gz
unzip ./libs/python3.7/h5py.zip 


# 2. full system update and upgrade
# shouldn't take long with latest JetPack
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


# TODO - this is making assumptions about previously created partitions
# NOTE: you may not require this step, it depends on your storage setup
# 3. mount ssd (this should be properly done, place holder for now)
sudo mkdir /xavier_ssd
sudo mkdir /xavier_ssd/minknow
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /xavier_ssd/


# 4. add nanopore repo to system and update
sudo cp nanoporetech.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
# add key
wget -O- https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/apt/ont-repo.pub | sudo apt-key add -
# copy the apt sources file from this repo to system to ensure pointing at mk1c repository
sudo cp nanoporetech.sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
# update repos
sudo apt update


# 5. install ont packages
# this step is pulling from the latest ONT repo with Mk1c packages
# if you are building from cached debs replace this step with 'dpkg -i *.deb'
# 12 packages required:
# - minknow-core-minion-1c-offline
# - ont-bream4-mk1c
# - ont-configuration-customer-mk1c
# - ont-kingfisher-ui-mk1c
# - ont-vbz-hdf-plugin
# - ont-minion1c-fpga
# - ont-jwt-auth
# - ont-minion1c-driver-4.4.38-minit
# - ont-minion1c-driver-udev
# - ont-remote-support
# - ont-system-identification
# - ont-vbz-hdf-plugin
# the 'manual' way, these packages will pull in other required depends
sudo apt install minknow-core-minion-1c-offline ont-bream4-mk1c \
  ont-configuration-customer-mk1c ont-kingfisher-ui-mk1c \
  ont-vbz-hdf-plugin ont-minion1c-fpga


# NOTE: this step has been modified after the release of guppy 4.2.2, which introduces guppy_basecall_client
# in place of the guppy_basecaller
# 6. copy guppy binaries to correct location, create sym links and check links and guppy version
sudo cp -r ont-guppy /opt/ont/
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecaller /usr/bin/guppy_basecaller
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecall_client /usr/bin/guppy_basecall_client
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecall_server /usr/bin/guppy_basecall_server
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecaller_supervisor /usr/bin/guppy_basecaller_supervisor
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_barcoder /usr/bin/guppy_barcoder
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_aligner /usr/bin/guppy_aligner
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/minimap2 /usr/bin/minimap2
# can check versions linked are correct
guppy_basecaller --version
guppy_basecall_server --version
guppy_aligner --version
guppy_barcoder --version
guppy_basecall_client --version
minimap2 --version


# 7. edit the minknow conf files to change the location of data and check guppy paths and parameters
# this can be done manually by using a text editor such as nano, this assumes you know what you want to edit:
#cd /opt/ont/minknow/conf
#sudo nano user_conf 
#sudo nano app_conf
# there is a config editor that ONT have made available (which is likely the easier approach to the above)
# edit the app_conf file
sudo /opt/ont/minknow/bin/config_editor --conf application \
  --filename /opt/ont/minknow/conf/app_conf \
  --set guppy.server_executable="/usr/bin/guppy_basecall_server" \
  --set guppy.client_executable="/usr/bin/guppy_basecall_client" \
  --set guppy.barcoding_executable="/usr/bin/guppy_basecall_barcoder" \
  --set guppy.alignment_executable="/usr/bin/guppy_basecall_aligner" \
  --set guppy.minimap_executable="/usr/bin/minimap2" \
  --set guppy.chunks_per_runner="64"
# NOTE: you can adjust chunks_per_runner depending on you available GPU, the default is 48, we've found 64 to be 
# a good spot for the Jetson Xavier NX
# edit the user_conf to set a user define storage location (and log file location if desired)
sudo /opt/ont/minknow/bin/config_editor --conf user \
  --filename /opt/ont/minknow/conf/user_conf \
  --set output_dirs.base="/data/minknow" \
  --set output_dirs.logs="/data/minknow/log/minknow"


# TODO: remove this step as no longer required
# NOTE: this step is no longer required with latest mk1c builds - skip to the next step.
# 8. install libhdf5-dev and copy across pre-compiled h5py (after removing old version)
# move back to git repo dir 
#cd ~/jetson_nanopore_sequencing
#sudo apt install libhdf5-dev
#sudo rm -rf /opt/ont/minknow/ont-python/lib/python3.7/site-packages/h5py/
#sudo cp -r libs/python3.7/h5py/ /opt/ont/minknow/ont-python/lib/python3.7/site-packages/


# 9. prevent boot into MinKNOW UI
# there is a script that will start the Kingfisher UI upon log in, we can stop this to get a full desktop environment
sudo sed -i '1 s/^/#/' /etc/xprofile
# to revert this if you want to essentially have a mk1c and not access the desktop
sudo sed -i '1 s/#//' /etc/xprofile


# 10. need to overwrite the values that identify the new device as a MinION Mk1c
# TODO - this is a horrible hack currently! At this stage we're hacking the Mk1c software to make it more "universal" for ARM devices.
# hopefully ONT will eventually release a mainline ARM64 version of the software that isn't tied to a specific device
# edit /etc/oxfordnanopore/configs/identity.config
sudo sed -i -e 's/Serial=.*/Serial=NONE/g' -e 's/ProductCode=.*/ProductCode=NONE/g' -e 's/Class=.*/Class=NONE/g' -e 's/Build=.*/Build=NONE/g' /etc/oxfordnanopore/configs/identity.config   
# Note: you can replace the Serial value of "NONE" with a value of your choice here if desired 
# (i.e. "My-XavNX", this is the value that will be used to name the device in ONT tools such as MinKNOW
# we need to do something similar in the app_conf file:
# edit /opt/ont/minknow/conf/app_conf
sudo sed -i -e 's/"device_type":.*/"device_type": "MinION",/' -e 's/"host_type":.*/"host_type": "PC",/' /opt/ont/minknow/conf/app_conf


# 11. Correct the MinKNOW UI zoom/scaling and remove the on screen keyboard
# The Mk1c software is designed to run on small 7inch touch screens, so there is a zoom factor that scales the UI and it looks
# bad on bigger screens. The software will also include a pop-up keyboard for touch screens by default. We turn these off.
sudo sed -i -e 's/--keyboard //g' -e 's/--zoom-factor 2/--zoom-factor 1/g' /usr/share/applications/minknow.desktop
# Note: if you are using a touch screen and would like the on screen keyboard then use the below:
sudo sed -i -e 's/--zoom-factor 2/--zoom-factor 1/g' /usr/share/applications/minknow.desktop


# 12. copy minknow.service and guppyd.service across 
# copy minknow.service for systemd set up and restart the service
# TODO - check this is still required, and check location of arm systemd files
# on latest x86_x64 Linux builds minknow.service is located in /lib/systemd/system/
# it likely doesn't matter, either seem to be respected
sudo cp minknow.service /etc/systemd/system/
service minknow restart
# check
service minknow status
# can check that the services are running as root with htop
# WARNING: with recent releases of MinKNOW there have been issues with directory permissions, and the Mk1b device not being detected
# a quick and dirty fix for this is to change the user and group from 'minknow' to 'root'. If you have these issues you can do run the below:
sudo sed -i -e 's/User=.*/User=root/g' -e 's/Group=.*/Group=root/g' /lib/systemd/system/minknow.service
# if you ever want to set this back to minknow that's easy as well:
sudo sed -i -e 's/User=.*/User=minknow/g' -e 's/Group=.*/Group=minknow/g' /lib/systemd/system/minknow.service
# just remember to always restart the service after modifying any of these files
#
sudo systemctl stop guppyd.service
# copy guppyd.service for systemd
sudo cp guppyd.service /lib/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable guppyd.service
sudo systemctl start guppyd.service
# check
systemctl status guppyd.service
# NOTE: the guppyd.service file contained in this repository is set with 8GB GPUs in mind, i.e. the Jetson Xavier NX
# these memory values can be edited to suit the GPU specs of a particular card/device, i.e. for the Xavier AGX a user
# might modify values to something like 24GB or even 32GB (I currently haven't test this)


## ONT have removed these binaries in a recent update making this step obsolete
# 13. Initialise attached MinIONs
# we have found that sometimes the MinION Mk1b isn't appearing/available in the MinKNOW UI
# running the below should load the correct firmware and initialise the device
#sudo /opt/ont/minknow/bin/minion_ctl init


# 14. you may require a system reboot at this stage. This is not always required, but for some people it sometimes fixes "niggles".
# TODO - confirm if this is required. I don't believe this to be required, but as a final hail mary it could be an option.


## optional steps

# install jetson-stats to allow nice hardware monitoring
# https://github.com/rbonghi/jetson_stats
sudo -H pip install -U jetson-stats
# needs a reboot/logout and then can use jtop
